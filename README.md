This is a fork off Merlyn's Fortify Skills mod which you can read about here: https://gitlab.com/Merlyn/valheimfortifyskills

All I did was add a configurable setting that, when enabled, prevents you from losing skills when PVP is enabled. We wanted this for our server because we love PVP, but we don't want to be reduced to level 1 in all skills. So we use WoV Zones to enforce PVP-disabled in all zones except the Arena and a few other locations.

server-safe-configs branch removed the exploitable configs, so that people on the server can't set their own local xp modifiers.
